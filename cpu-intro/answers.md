1. Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the `-c` and `-p` flags to see if you were right.

2 processes are spawned w/ 100% CPU utilization, 5 time units of 1st process executes first and then 5 units of the second. While 1st process is running, 2d is in the READY state. And while 2d is running, 1st is in the DONE state.

2. Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the
CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use `-c` and `-p` to find out if you were right.

4 units of P1 execute first in a row, P2 is READY. Then happens io switch, waitig for io (5 units) and io termination.
11 units of work, 6 loaded by CPU (including `RUN:io` and `RUN:io_done`), utilization of CPU is 54.5%

3. Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use `-c`
and `-p` to see if you were right).

After 1st process issued IO and get blocked, 2nd will start runnning. During the cycles 1...4 P1 finishes w/ IO and P2 finishes its work.
7 units spent in total
CPU utilization is 85.7%

4. Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

P1 will exclusively occupy the time 1-7, during which P2 will be READY. Then P2 is executing during 8-11.
Utilization of CPU is 54.5%

5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is `WAITING` for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use `-c` and `-p` to confirm that you are right.

The same result as in 3

6. One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes?
(`./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

System resources are badly utilized because there's no guarantee that all IO cycles will be executed in a row, and so some of them might be executing alone:

7. Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

All the units of P0 are going in a row thus providing the best possible utilization.

8. Now run with some randomly generated processes using flags `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50, 3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` versus that flag `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use the flag `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` versus `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

Best utilization w/ `python3 ./process-run.py -s 1 -l 3:50,3:50 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE -c`

worse ulitilization in case of `python3 ./process-run.py -s 3 -l 3:50,3:50 -S SWITCH_ON_END -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE -c`
due to waiting for IO to end before switching.
